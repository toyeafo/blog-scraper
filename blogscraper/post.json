Visual Builder is more than capable of building the exact same types of pages as you would achieve with the Classic Builder, and more. The key difference is that this Builder is considered an ‘in-line’ editor, this means that you are able to directly edit, update and optimise content from directly within the page - exactly as your audience would see it. Therefore, the Visual Builder provides you with a more efficient and intuitive editing toolkit.", "view_stream", "Classic Builder", "Classic Builder enables you to create and edit pages of all kinds directly from within the Site Admin.

It’s great for making quick changes while you are inside the admin, but it is rendered as a ‘block-based’ representation of your website. To have a correct visual representation, previewing the page is required.", "The Visual Builder, on the other hand, allows you to build your pages directly from within the front-end of your website (known as ‘in-line’ editing). It allows for much faster design, and provides a more intuitive user interface. When you add content or adjust design settings inside the visual builder, your changes appear instantly.

This allowed you to add content and images, however it was inconsistent with adding content to the rest of the page.

Resolution size is just the width and height of the screen. Different size monitors will have different resolutions.

For a content page header, this might be slightly smaller at around 300 pixels.", "If a users browser is 1200 pixels wide and you've set your page header to 600 pixels high, your header will be displayed in a 1200x600 pixel area. Still with me?", "If the user's browser is larger and 2500 pixels wide and the page header is still set to 600 pixels, your header will be displayed in a 2500x600 pixel area.", "These are 2 quite different sizes and our image needs to work well on both. We need to make sure our image has enough width to work on the 2500 widescreen whilst keeping anything important within the middle 1200 pixels as anything outside this width is at risk of being cut off on smaller screens.", "So with this in mind, we recommend creating header images that are 2500 pixels wide and approx 600-1000 pixels high (depending on your header height), remembering anything outside the middle 1200 pixels may be cropped off on smaller screens.", "What makes a good image?", "This actually depends on what content is going in your header. The majority of the time you’ll have some text and possibly buttons within your header. Ideally, you don't want your text and buttons to overlay anything important in your image. This is especially important if you feature people in your image. You don’t want a button or text covering someone's face.", "The best images for headers containing text and buttons will;", "Allow text and buttons to be displayed clearly", "Have the main focus of the image to one side", "Wide enough to allow for high-resolution monitors.", "Keep the main focus of the image within the middle 1200 pixels of the image. This will make sure it doesn't get cut off on smaller screens.", "Be easily scaled outwards. Having clear space around the focus point of the image.", "Let's take a look at some examples.", "Example 1", ": Background image no text overlay. Here's our image we've uploaded. It's 2500x900 pixels.", "If the header were displayed on a 1024 pixel wide resolution screen. You can see the people on the left and right-hand sides have been cropped out.", "Our header on a 2500 pixel wide resolution screen. You can see now because the browser has more width we can see our missing people.", "Example 2", ": This ticks all the boxes for a great header image. Clear space around our hero couple. Buttons and text in clear space. Easily scalable colours left and right of the couple if we need to extend the image for extreme landscape resolutions.", "Uploaded background image:", "Header at 1400 pixel wide resolution:", "Header at 2500 pixel wide resolution:", "Example 3", ": If you aren’t featuring people (faces or hero shots) and it’s more of a textured background then it’s going to be a lot easier to place your text within the header.", "Example 4", ": The uploaded image contains a logo or graphic.", "Because the logo is part of the image it will scale with the header as seen below. This will always be problematic across different resolutions. Try and avoid having flattened images like this example. Separate the logo and the background into 2 separate images. Upload the separated background image as your header background image and insert the logo into the header content area. This will allow the logo to float on top of the background and be responsive.", "Finally", "You may not always be able to see what this looks like on a larger screen as you have a smaller monitor but knowing you’ve set the width and height to account for all screens will safeguard your header designs. You can always drop us a support ticket and we can double-check them for you!", "So in summary...", "Try and use", "Images that have clear space around people or backgrounds that can easily be scaled to create extra space", "Landscape images. 16:9 ratio. The wider usually the better!", "Try and avoid", "Cropping people on larger resolutions. Try and keep everyone's head on the screen :)", "Critical content falling outside the main 1200 pixel wide viewing area", "Using text as images within the header", "Uploading very large images. If you upload an image straight from a stock photo and don’t resize it’s going to be a large file weight which will affect your page load time.", "What about mobile?", "All the same rules apply to mobile. However mobile header resolution is generally more portrait in ratio compared to landscape on desktop and the ratio doesn't vary nearly as much. We suggest creating your headers at approx 1000 pixels wide and 1400 pixels high depending on the look you are after for your header. By default your desktop header will work on mobile.

You may have seen the prompts yourself as it was a common occurance for people in our industry when sharing a public fundraising page on Facebook you would often experience prompts to also create a page within facebook itself.", "Initially this was met with frustration in our industry since charities themselves really had no control over who setup pages and how they were managed and too often a fundraiser didn't really understand what it was that they were doing, they were often merely trying to share a page for an event that they had just signed up to and along came Facebook prompting them to create a second one, which many did, but the catch then was that anyone that donated to their Facebook page didn't get recognised on their \"actual\" fundraising page on the charity's site.", "Additionally, for anyone actually wantingto create a facebook fundraising page it is a very manual process and one that exposes the fundraiser to numerous other charities whilst setting up their page, so it was almost a step backwards to how things were on shared platforms.", "To counteract this Facebook released an API that allowed charities to control certain aspects of this and also get access to basic donation data made on Facebook so at least any donations received on Facebook could be reflected on their public facing page.", "How it Works", "Limitations", "Getting Started", "Setting up your Platform", "How it Works", "When a fundraiser signs up to an event or creates a DIY page you can offer them the choice to then create a facebook fundraising page which acts like an extension of their online fundraising page.", "This Facebook fundraising page can only be accessed from within Facebook itself, it isn't a public page so it's only visible to the fundraiser's facebook friends.", "Any donation then made to the Facebook fundraising page will also appear on their public fundraising page on your site.", "Limitations", "There are naturally a few limitations to the integration which it is important to know of.", "Firstly, the donation data that we get back from Facebook is only the Amount, we don't get any personal details at all from donors donating to Facebook fundraising pages.", "Secondly, since the transaction takes place in Facebook you wont get access to the transaction data in Funraisin nor will you be able to perform common tasks like refunds or reconciliation.
